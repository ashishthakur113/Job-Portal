🔗 **Live Demo:** [SkillHire Job Portal](https://skillhire-job-portal.netlify.app/)


## 📖 Overview

**SkillHire** is a **frontend-only** job portal built with **React**.  
It’s a **fun practice project** created to explore React, LocalStorage, and Context API.

The platform includes basic job search, viewing job details, a profile page, and a simple application form that shows a success message after submission.  
There’s also a basic login/signup system and a job upload page (still very basic and needs improvement).

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is just a practice build. Many features are minimal and can be improved in the future with backend integration, advanced filtering, and better UI/UX.
